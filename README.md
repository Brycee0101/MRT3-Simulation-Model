# Simulating an Optimized MRT3 system to solve Overcrowding using Discrete Event Simulation

This Discrete Event Simulation (DES) MRT3 model is developed to simulate and examine the diverse elements at play in the MRT3 system, such as headways, active trains, and passenger arrival rates. The general intent is to find a cost-effective and efficient resolution to handle overcrowding in MRT3, mainly during peak hours, which could lead to passenger discomfort and crimes being perpetrated inside the MRT. The simulation results deliver insights into how the system can maximize passenger throughput but minimize overcrowding, especially during peak hours. 

## Findings
The established DES model captures the real-world dynamics of the MRT3 system and simulates its behavior under various configurations. Through careful data analysis and simulation, we examine the impact of different headways, the number of active trains, and passenger arrival rates on system performance.

The simulation results highlight the potential of optimizing train schedules and headways to maximize passenger throughput while minimizing overcrowding. We find that maintaining 75% train capacity and 50% station capacity during peak hours can lead to efficient passenger flow and reduced overcrowding, based on our analysis of real-world data.

## Future Work
While the initial simulation results show promising outcomes, we acknowledge that there is room for further improvement. As part of future research, we intend to explore advanced algorithms and optimization techniques to enhance the MRT3 system's efficiency further. Additionally, we plan to investigate other factors, such as station layout modifications and passenger flow management strategies, to offer comprehensive solutions to the authorities.
