# Simulating an Optimized MRT3 system to solve Overcrowding using Discrete Event Simulation

This Discrete Event Simulation (DES) MRT3 model is developed to simulate and examine the diverse elements at play in the MRT3 system, such as headways, active trains, and passenger arrival rates. The general intent is to find a cost-effective and efficient resolution to handle overcrowding in MRT3, mainly during peak hours, which could lead to passenger discomfort and crimes being perpetrated inside the MRT. The simulation results deliver insights into how the system can maximize passenger throughput but minimize overcrowding, especially during peak hours. 

## Findings
The established DES model captures the real-world dynamics of the MRT3 system and simulates its behavior under various configurations. Through careful data analysis and simulation, we examine the impact of different headways, the number of active trains, and passenger arrival rates on system performance.

Through adjusting these values, it was determined that the occurrence of overcrowding is at its lowest when both the train speed and the number of trains deployed are at their highest possible values used for the study (65 kph and 23 trains). This substantiated that three more trains can be added during peak hours to the current 20 trains configuration of MRT. It would further decrease the lowest headway (4 mins) by 20 seconds. Out of the seven scenarios simulated, the ideal initial occupancies of trains and station platforms are 75%:50% ratio, in this high volume scenario, overcrowding is still minimized. A vital derivative to note from these simulations also is that to reduce the headway to 3 mins, the trains must be able to traverse at least 79 kph.

## Future Work
While the initial simulation results show promising outcomes, we acknowledge that there is room for further improvement. As part of future research, we intend to explore advanced algorithms and optimization techniques to enhance the MRT3 system's efficiency further. Additionally, we plan to investigate other factors, such as station layout modifications and passenger flow management strategies, to offer comprehensive solutions to the authorities.
